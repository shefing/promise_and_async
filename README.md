# promise_and_async
mentoring session about promise and async/await
Two short node console apps to understand promises and ES7 features
- `async_promise.js` demonstrates usage of promise: Creation of promise and consumption of promise. Create promise and fullfill or reject it,
one invoking a server for Ron's quote and one trivial (stupid) promise, delivering, trivial hard coded string.
- `async_es7.js` demontrates the same app with async and await
